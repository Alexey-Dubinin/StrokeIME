To build this program from sources you must have installed android sdk 
software of version 8.

Then you must create a file named local.properties with the following content:
=========== begin ===============
sdk.dir=$ANDROID_SDK_DIR
===========  end  ===============
where ANDROID_SDK_DIR is the root directory of the Android SDK
for example,
sdk.dir=/opt/android-sdk

Place this file in the root directory of the project.

Also, you must edit file $ANDROID_SDK_DIR/tools/ant/ant_rules_r3.xml in the 
following way:
- find the "compile" target
- find the "javac" task
- set the "encoding" attribute to "utf8" instead of "ascii"

finally, change to the project directory and run:
> ant clean debug
You can find the .apk in the bin/ directory
